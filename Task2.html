ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">When the
Editor of the following volumes published, about two years since, the
work called the “Antiquary,” he announced that he was, for the
last time, intruding upon the public in his present capacity. He
might shelter himself under the plea that every anonymous writer is,
like the celebrated Junius, only a phantom, and that therefore,
although an apparition, of a more benign, as well as much meaner
description, he cannot be bound to plead to a charge of
inconsistency. A better apology may be found in the imitating the
confession of honest Benedict, that, when he said he would die a
bachelor, he did not think he should live to be married. The best of
all would be, if, as has eminently happened in the case of some
distinguished contemporaries, the merit of the work should, in the
reader's estimation, form an excuse for the Author's breach of
promise. Without presuming to hope that this may prove the case, it
is only further necessary to mention, that his resolution, like that
of Benedict, fell a sacrifice, to temptation at least, if not to
stratagem.</P></div>

INTRODUCTION—-(1829)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">When the
author projected this further encroachment on the patience of an
indulgent public, he was at some loss for a title; a good name being
very nearly of as much consequence in literature as in life. The
title of <I>Rob Roy</I> was suggested by the late Mr. Constable,
whose sagacity and experience foresaw the germ of popularity which it
included.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">No
introduction can be more appropriate to the work than some account of
the singular character whose name is given to the title-page, and
who, through good report and bad report, has maintained a wonderful
degree of importance in popular recollection. This cannot be ascribed
to the distinction of his birth, which, though that of a gentleman,
had in it nothing of high destination, and gave him little right to
command in his clan. Neither, though he lived a busy, restless, and
enterprising life, were his feats equal to those of other
freebooters, who have been less distinguished. He owed his fame in a
great measure to his residing on the very verge of the Highlands, and
playing such pranks in the beginning of the 18th century, as are
usually ascribed to Robin Hood in the middle ages,—and that within
forty miles of Glasgow, a great commercial city, the seat of a
learned university. Thus a character like his, blending the wild
virtues, the subtle policy, and unrestrained license of an American
Indian, was flourishing in Scotland during the Augustan age of Queen
Anne and George I. Addison, it is probable, or Pope, would have been
considerably surprised if they had known that there existed in the
same island with them a personage of Rob Roy's peculiar habits and
profession. It is this strong contrast betwixt the civilised and
cultivated mode of life on the one side of the Highland line, and the
wild and lawless adventures which were habitually undertaken and
achieved by one who dwelt on the opposite side of that ideal
boundary, which creates the interest attached to his name.</P></div>

CHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.</H2>
<PRE CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align: left">              But now the hand of fate is on the curtain,
                     And gives the scene to light.
                                         Don Sebastian.</PRE><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">
I felt stunned and chilled as they retired. Imagination, dwelling on
an absent object of affection, paints her not only in the fairest
light, but in that in which we most desire to behold her. I had
thought of Diana as she was, when her parting tear dropped on my
cheek—when her parting token, received from the wife of MacGregor,
augured her wish to convey into exile and conventual seclusion the
remembrance of my affection. I saw her; and her cold passive manner,
expressive of little except composed melancholy, disappointed, and,
in some degree, almost offended me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">In the
egotism of my feelings, I accused her of indifference—of
insensibility. I upbraided her father with pride—with cruelty—with
fanaticism,—forgetting that both were sacrificing their interest,
and Diana her inclination, to the discharge of what they regarded as
their duty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">Sir Frederick
Vernon was a rigid Catholic, who thought the path of salvation too
narrow to be trodden by an heretic; and Diana, to whom her father's
safety had been for many years the principal and moving spring of
thoughts, hopes, and actions, felt that she had discharged her duty
in resigning to his will, not alone her property in the world, but
the dearest affections of her heart. But it was not surprising that I
could not, at such a moment, fully appreciate these honourable
motives; yet my spleen sought no ignoble means of discharging itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">“I am
contemned, then,” I said, when left to run over the tenor of Sir
Frederick's communications—“I am contemned, and thought unworthy
even to exchange words with her. Be it so; they shall not at least
prevent me from watching over her safety. Here will I remain as an
outpost, and, while under my roof at least, no danger shall threaten
her, if it be such as the arm of one determined man can avert.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">I summoned
Syddall to the library. He came, but came attended by the eternal
Andrew, who, dreaming of great things in consequence of my taking
possession of the Hall and the annexed estates, was resolved to lose
nothing for want of keeping himself in view; and, as often happens to
men who entertain selfish objects, overshot his mark, and rendered
his attentions tedious and inconvenient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">His
unrequired presence prevented me from speaking freely to Syddall, and
I dared not send him away for fear of increasing such suspicions as
he might entertain from his former abrupt dismissal from the library.
“I shall sleep here, sir,” I said, giving them directions to
wheel nearer to the fire an old-fashioned day-bed, or settee. “I
have much to do, and shall go late to bed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">Syddall, who
seemed to understand my look, offered to procure me the accommodation
of a mattress and some bedding. I accepted his offer, dismissed my
attendant, lighted a pair of candles, and desired that I might not be
disturbed till seven in the ensuing morning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">The domestics
retired, leaving me to my painful and ill-arranged reflections, until
nature, worn out, should require some repose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="line-height: 115%">I endeavoured
forcibly to abstract my mind from the singular circumstances in which
I found myself placed. Feelings which I had gallantly combated while
the exciting object was remote, were now exasperated by my immediate
neighbourhood to her whom I was so soon to part with for ever. Her
name was written in every book which I attempted to peruse; and her
image forced itself on me in whatever train of thought I strove to
engage myself. It was like the officious slave of Prior's Solomon,—</P>
